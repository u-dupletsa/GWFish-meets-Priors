    "We want to compare the standard Bayesian results of the LVK GWTC data to a faster Fisher matrix approach (with and without adding the prior information). Therefore, we proceed as follows:\n",
    "1. We need **injections**: we consider BBH events (for which we have a record of the priors that were used for the Beysian analysis) and, in particular, we take the median value from the GWTC data as the injection for `gwfish`\n",
    "2. We need the list of **detectors** that detected each event and their **sensitivity curve** (since we know which detectors were operational for a given event, we do not consider the duty cycle)\n",
    "3. We do not impose any SNR threshold for the Fisher analysis (even though it is customary to set a threshold of at least SNR=8 for the Fisher analysis)\n",
    "4. We impose the very same **priors** as described in the LVK records"
